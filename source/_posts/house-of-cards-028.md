bunch of merry men has distinguished itself recently. A poor election campaign, then all those infuriating bloody leaks. Now I'm told that the news of my visit to the Palace yesterday also leaked out of the backdoor at Smith Square.'

His tone hardened. ‘I can't forgive that, Francis. The

Cabinet swore on their oaths of office to keep it confidential, to let me offer my resignation with some dignity

instead of being the clown in a damned media circus. I will not stand for it. I will not have party headquarters interfering in this election!'

He leaned towards Urquhart. ‘I suspect you have no great love for Teddy Williams, particularly after he did such an effective demolition job on your reshuffle proposals - I'm sure you guessed that at the time’

Urquhart was glad to have his suspicions confirmed. On Judgement Day it might help to justify a lot of his recent actions.

'So what can I do, Francis, to make sure this election is run properly?'

Urquhart smiled to himself. A 'proper' election was now defined as one in which Michael Samuel felt the full force of the Prime Minister's revenge.

￼￼￼￼￼'My interests, like yours, are simply to ensure fair play. I know that neither you nor I wish to interfere in any way - let party democracy have its way, of course. My only concern is that the process is likely to go ahead in such a rush that there will be no proper time for mature reflection or consideration. In the past, leadership elections have taken place only a week to ten days after they were announced - Ted Heath was elected just five days after

Alec Douglas-Home resigned - but on those occasions the resignations were expected. People had time to think, to make a proper and balanced judgement. That won't be the case this time. I'm afraid it will all be over in a breathless rush, and become just another part of the media circus’ 'So?'

'So give them just a little longer to make their choice. Slow the pace down. Enjoy your last few weeks in office, and hand over to a successor who has been chosen by the Party, not the media’

'What you say makes sense. I've no wish to extend the period of uncertainty while the campaign is fought, but I'm sure an extra week or so could do no great harm.'

He extended his hand towards Urquhart. 'Francis, I'm sorry to cut this short; Humphrey will be waiting outside. I

shall have to consult him as Chairman of the Backbench Committee, but the final choice on timing is entirely in my hands. I'm going to think very carefully overnight about what you have said, and let you know in the morning what I decide.'

He led the Chief Whip towards the door. 'I'm so grateful, Francis. It's really comforting to have a source of advice with no axe to grind.'

Samuel is favoured candidate -takes early lead in party soundings

Michael Samuel, the youthful Environment Secretary, was last night emerging as the early front runner to succeed Henry Collingridge as Party Leader and Prime Minister.

In a poll conducted during the last two days by the Telegraph amongst 212 of the 337 Government MPs eligible to vote, 24 per cent nominated him as their first choice in the forthcoming party leadership election, well ahead of other potential candidates.

While Samuel has yet to announce his candidature, he is expected to do so soon. Moreover, he is expected

to get the backing of influential party figures such as Lord Williams, the Party Chairman, whose influence as the Party's elder statesman could be crucial.

No other name attracted more than 18 per cent. Five potential candidates obtained between 12 per

cent and 18 per cent, including Patrick Woolton the Foreign Secretary, Arnold Dollis the Home Secretary,

Harold Earle the Education Secretary, Peter McKenzie the Health Secretary, and Francis Urquhart the Chief Whip.

The inclusion of Urquhart's name in the list at 14 per cent caused something of a surprise last night at Westminster, as he is not even a full member of the Cabinet. As Chief Whip he has a strong base in the Parliamentary Party and could be a strong outside candidate. However, sources close to Urquhart last

night emphasised he had made no decision to enter the contest, and he would clarify his position sometime today.'

'Mattie, I think I've got it!'

Krajewski was striding across the room as if he had discovered a blazing fire in his pocket. He was breathless

with excitement. As he reached Mattie's desk in the Telegraph news room, he pulled a lOx 12 colour photograph out of the large manila envelope he was clutching, and threw it on her desk. The face of the driver stared at her, slightly blurred and distorted from the lines of the video screen, but nonetheless clearly recognisable.

‘Freddie came up trumps. He took this along to his meeting of AA last night, and the group leader recognised it immediately. It's a Dr Robert Christian, who's a well known authority on the treatment of drug and alcohol

addiction. Runs a treatment centre in a large private house near the south coast in Kent. That's where our Charlie is bound to be’ He was flushed with triumph.

'Johnnie, I could kiss you - but not in the office!'

His face contorted into a picture of mock misery.

'And there I was hoping you would want to sleep your way to the top...' he said mournfully.

The Prime Minister read all the newspapers that morning. He smiled ruefully as he read the commentaries which a week before had been excoriating him and for the most part were now, in their fickle and inconstant fashion, lauding him for his statesmanlike and responsible action in allowing the Government to make a fresh start - 'although he must still resolve many outstanding personal and family

issues to the public's satisfaction', thundered The Times. As always, the press had no shame in playing both sides.

He read the Telegraph particularly carefully, and twice. Their prompt polling of Government MPs had given them

a lead over the other journals, many of which were forced to

refer to the poll findings in their later editions. The consensus seemed to be emerging: it was an open race but Samuel was clearly the front runner.

￼He summoned his political secretary.

'Grahame. I want you to send an instruction to Lord Williams, with a copy to Sir Humphrey Newlands. Party headquarters are to issue a press release at 12.30 this afternoon for the lunchtime news that nominations for election as Leader of the Party will close in three weeks' time, on Thursday November 18, with the first ballot to take place on the following Tuesday November 23. If a second ballot is required it will be held as prescribed by the Party's rules on the following Tuesday, November 30, with any final run-off ballot two days later. Have you got that?'

He noticed his secretary's obvious anguish. It was the first time since his resignation announcement that they had been able to talk.

That means in exactly six weeks and one day, Grahame, you and I will be out of a job. Don't worry. You've been an

excellent aide to me. I haven't always found time as I should to thank you properly in the past, but I want you to know I'm very grateful.'

The aide shuffled with embarrassment.

'You must start thinking about your own future. I'm certain that there are several newly knighted gentlemen in

the City or any other part of industry who would be happy to make you a generous offer. Think about it for a few days and let me know what interests you. I still have a few favours to cash in.'

The secretary mumbled his thanks, looking much relieved, and made to depart

'By the way, Grahame. It's possible that the Party Chairman might seek to get hold of me and encourage me to shorten the period of the election process. I shall not be available, and you are to ensure he realises that these are instructions, not terms for negotiation, and they are to be issued without fail by 12.30.'

There was a short pause.

'Otherwise, tell him, I shall be forced to leak them myself.'

It is often written that time and tide wait for no man. They certainly did not wait that day for Michael Samuel. He had

been as openly astounded and as privately elated by Collingridge's bombshell as the rest of his colleagues. His

natural enthusiasm had quickly turned to the positive aspect of events, and the opportunities which they afforded

him. He recognised that no one started the race as favourite, and that he had as good a chance as any, if he played his cards right.

He had consulted the redoubtable Lord Williams, who agreed on his assessment of his chances. 'Patience,

Michael,' he had advised. 'You will almost certainly be the youngest candidate, and they will try to say you are too

youthful, too inexperienced and too ambitious. So don't look too much as if you want the job. Show a little restraint, and let them come to you.'

Which was to prove excellent advice, but entirely irrelevant to the circumstances. The media had been

having a busy day. No sooner had the Telegraph hit the streets promoting Samuel's name than Urquhart appeared in front of television cameras to confirm that he had no intention of standing, because he felt it was in the Party's best interests that the Chief Whip should be entirely impartial in this contest. These two events had the instant effect of getting the media hunt firmly under way for those candidates who would be standing, and promoting a wide degree of praise for Urquhart's unselfishness and loyalty. The release later that morning of the detailed timetable for nomination and election only added fuel to the flames. None of which helped the front runner.

By the time the television cameras had tracked him down to the Intercontinental Hotel off Hyde Park, which

he was just about to enter for an early lunch meeting, they were in no mood to accept conditional answers. He couldn't say no, they wouldn't accept maybe, and after some considerable harassment he was forced into making a reluctant announcement that he would indeed be running.

The one o'clock news offered a clear contrast between Urquhart, in a dignified and elder party statesman role declining to run, and the youthful and apparently eager Samuel, holding an impromptu press conference on the street and launching himself as the first official candidate, nearly a month before the first ballot was to be held.

As Urquhart watched the proceedings with considerable satisfaction, the telephone rang. A gruff voice which he

recognised instantly as Landless said simply, 'Moses parted the Red Sea. We shall see whether Michael can catch the tide.'

They both laughed before the voice rang off.

￼SATURDAY 30th OCTOBER

The following Saturday, Mattie had a clear day. She climbed into her BMW, filled it with petrol, and pointed it in the direction of Dover. Having barged her way through the shopping crowds of Greenwich, she emerged with great relief onto the A2, the old Roman road which for nearly two thousand years had pointed the way from London into the heart of Kent. It took her past the cathedral town of Canterbury, and a few miles beyond she turned off at the picturesque little village of Barham. Her road map was not very helpful in finding the even smaller village of Norbington nearby, but with the help of several locals she found herself some while later outside a large Victorian house, bearing a. subdued sign in the shrubbery which announced, 'Fellowship Treatment Centre'.
