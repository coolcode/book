There were several cars in the driveway and the front door was open. She was surprised to see people wandering around with apparent freedom, and no sign of the formidable white-coated nurses she had expected to find patrolling the grounds for potential escapees. She parked her car on the road and walked cautiously up the drive towards the door.

A large, tweed-suited gentleman with a white military moustache approached and her heart sank. This was surely the security patrol, and she had clearly been spotted as an intruder.

'Excuse me, my dear,' he said in a clipped accent as he intercepted her by the front door. 'Have you seen any member of staff about? They like to keep out of the way on family visiting days, but you can never find one when you want them.'

Mattie offered her apologies and smiled warmly in relief. She realised that by good fortune she had struck the best possible day to look around, and could lose herself amidst the other visitors.

She picked up one of the brochures which were piled on the hall table, and found a quiet chair on which to sit while she inspected it. A brief glance at the literature told her that the treatment centre was run on very different lines than she had imagined. No straitjackets, no locks on the doors, just twenty-three well-trained people waiting to give guidance, encouragement and their medical experience to addicts who sought help in an atmosphere resembling more a fashionable country retreat than an institution. Even more encouragingly for Mattie, the brochure had a plan of the thirty-two-bed house, which Mattie used to guide herself around the premises in search of her quarry.

She found him outside on a garden bench, enjoying the view across the valley and the last of the October sun. She wasn't going to enjoy the deception, but that is what she had come for.

'Why, Charles!' she exclaimed. 'What a surprise to find you here.'

He looked at her with a total lack of comprehension.

‘I... I'm sorry,' he ventured. ‘I don't recognise...'

'Mattie Storin. Don't you remember? We spent a most enjoyable evening together in Bournemouth a couple of weeks ago.'

'Oh, I'm sorry, Miss Storin. I don't remember. You see, I'm an alcoholic, that's why I'm here, and I'm afraid I was in no condition a few weeks ago to remember very much at all.'

She was taken aback by his frankness, and he smiled serenely.

‘Please don't be embarrassed. The biggest single step I've had to make in curing myself of addiction is to admit that I am an addict. I had a million ways of hiding it, particularly from myself, and it was only when I was able to face myself that I began being able to face the outside world again. That's what this treatment centre is all about.'

Mattie suddenly blushed deeply. She realised that she had intruded into the private world of a sick man, and she felt ashamed. 'Charles, if you don't remember who I am, then you will not remember that I am a journalist.'

The smile disappeared, to be replaced by a look of resignation.

‘I suppose it had to happen at some time, although Henry was hoping that I could be left alone here quietly...'

'Charles, please let me explain. I've not come here to make life difficult for you, and when I leave here your privacy will continue to be respected so far as I am concerned. I think the press owe you that.'

‘I think they probably do...'

'But I would like your help. Don't say anything for the moment, just let me talk a little.' He nodded in encouragement.

'Your brother, the Prime Minister, has been forced to resign because of allegations that he helped you to speculate in shares and make a quick profit.'

He started to wave his hand to bring her to a halt but she pressed on.

'Charles, none of those allegations make any sense to me. You and your brother risking the office of Prime Minister for a measly few thousand pounds - it doesn't add up. What's more, I also know that someone has deliberately been trying to undermine your brother for some time by leaking

￼damaging material to the press. But I only have suspicions. I came to see if you could point me towards something more tangible.'

'Miss Storin - Mattie, as we seem to be old friends -’I am a drunk. I cannot even remember meeting you. How can I, of all people, be of help? My word carries no weight whatsoever.'

‘I’m neither a judge nor a prosecutor, Charles. I'm just trying to piece together a puzzle from a thousand scattered shards’ He looked far over the hills towards Dover and the Channel beyond, searching in the distance.

'Mattie, I've tried so hard to remember, believe me. The thought that I have disgraced Henry and forced him into resignation is almost more than I can stand. But I know nothing about buying and selling shares, nothing at all. I don't know what the truth is. I can't help you, I'm afraid.'

'Wouldn't you have remembered something about buying the shares, if you had indeed bought them?'

‘For the last month I have been a very sick...' - he laughed gently -'... a very drunk man. There are many things I have absolutely no recollection of.'

'Wouldn't you have remembered where you got the money to buy the shares, or what you did with the proceeds?'

‘I admit that it's hugely unlikely I would have had a small fortune lying around without my remembering it or, more likely, spending it on alcohol. I have no idea where the money could have gone. Even I can't drink away £50,000 in just a few weeks.'

'What about the false address in Paddington?'

'A complete mystery. I don't even know where Praed Street in Paddington is when I'm sober, so it is preposterous to suppose I would have found my way there drunk. It's the other side of London from where I live.'

'But you used it - so they say - for your bank and subscription to the Party's literature service.'

Charles Collingridge roared with laughter. 'Mattie, you're beginning to restore my faith in myself. No matter how drunk I was, I cannot conceive I could possibly have shown any interest in the Party's literature service. I object when political propaganda is pushed through my letter box at election time; having to pay for it every month would be an insult!'

'Have you ever contributed to the Party's literature service?' 'Never!’

The sun was setting and a warm, red glow filled the sky, lighting up his face. He seemed visibly to be returning to health, and to be content. ‘I can't prove it, but I don't believe I am guilty of the things they say I have done. It would mean a lot to me if you believed that, too.'

‘I do, Charles, very much. And I'm going to try to prove it for you.'

She rose to leave.

'I've enjoyed your visit, Mattie. Now that we are such old friends, please come again.'

'I shall. But in the meantime, I've got a lot of digging to do.'

It was late by the time she got back to London that evening. The first editions of the Sunday newspapers were already on the streets. She bought a heavy pile of them and, with magazines and inserts slipping from her laden arms, she threw them on the back seat of her car. It was then she noticed the Sunday Times headline.

'Now why is Harold Earle making such a fuss about environmental matters?' she asked herself. The Education Secretary, not a noted Greenpeace lover, had just announced his intention to stand for the leadership and simultaneously had made a speech entitled 'Clean Up Our Country.'

'We have talked and talked endlessly about the problems of our inner cities, while those who live in them have been forced to watch their neighbourhoods continue to decline. In the meantime, the impoverished state of our inner cities has been matched by the deplorable degeneration of far too much of our rural countryside,' the Sunday Times reported him as saying. 'For too long we have neglected such issues, to our cost. Recycled expressions of concern are no substitute for positive action, and it is time we backed our fine words with finer deeds. The opinion polls show that the environment is the most important non-economic issue on which the voters say we have failed. After more than twelve years in office, this is unacceptable, and we must wake up to these concerns’

'Silly me’ said Mattie. I'm getting slow in my old age. Can't decipher the code. Which Cabinet Minister is supposed to be responsible for environmental matters, and therefore responsible for this mess?'

The public fight to eliminate Michael Samuel had begun.

￼WEDNESDAY 3rd NOVEMBER

Mattie tried many times during the following week to get hold of Kevin Spence, but he was never available. In spite of the repeated assurances of his gushingly polite secretary, Mattie knew that he was deliberately avoiding her. He was therefore not at all pleased when, in some desperation, she called very late on Wednesday evening and was put straight through to his extension by the night security guard.

'No, of course I haven't been avoiding you’ he assured her, 'but I havebeen very busy. Working very late.' 'Kevin, I need your help again.'

‘I remember the last time I gave you my help. You said you were going towrite a piece on opinion polls and then

you wrote a story slandering thePrime Minister. Now he's gone.' He spoke with a quiet sadness. 'Hewas always very decent to me, very kind, and I think the press have been unspeakably cruel.'

'Kevin, I give you my word that I was not responsible for that story. Youmay have noticed that my name was not on the article, and I was evenmore displeased about it than

you. It's about Mr Collingridge'sresignation that I'm calling. Personally, I don't believe the allegationswhich are being made against him and his brother. I would like to be able to clear his name.'

‘I can't see how I could assist you,' he said in a distrusting tone. 'Anyway,I'm afraid that nobody outside the press office is allowed to have contactwith the media during the leadership campaign. Chairman's strictestorders.'

'Kevin, there's a lot at stake here. Not only the leadership, of the Party,and whether you are going to win the next election or not, but alsowhether history is going to regard Henry Collingridge as a crook and acheat or whether he is going to have a chance to put the record straight.Don't we owe him that?'

He thought about it for a second, and she heard his hostility slowlymelting.

If I could help, what would you want?'

'Very simply, do you understand the computer system at partyheadquarters?'

'Yes, of course. I use it all the time to help analyse opinion research. I'vegot a screen in front of me which is linked directly to our main frame.' ‘I think your computer system has been tampered with. Will you let mesee it?'

Tampered with? That's impossible. We have the highest security.Nobody from outside can access it.'

'Not outside, Kevin. Inside.'

There was a stunned silence from the other end of the phone.

I'm working at the House of Commons. I can be with you in less than tenminutes, and I suspect at this time of night the building is very quiet. Noone will notice. Kevin, I'm on my way over.'

Before he could mutter a flustered few words of protest, the phone wentdead as he held it. Mattie was with him less than seven minutes later.

They sat in his small garret office, dominated by the mountains of fileswhich tumbled over every available fiat surface and onto the floor, withtheir attention fixed rigidly on the glowing green screen in front of them.
