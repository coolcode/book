'Kevin, Charles Collingridge ordered material from the Party's sales andliterature service and asked them to be delivered to an address inPaddington. Right?’

'Correct. I checked it as soon as I heard, but it's there all right. Look.'

He tapped a few characters on the keyboard, and up came theincriminating evidence on the screen.

'Chas Collingridge Esq 216 Praed St Paddington London W2 — 001 A’01.0091.'

'What do these other hieroglyphics mean?'

'The first set simply means that he subscribes to our comprehensiveliterature service and the second that his subscription has been fullypaid from the beginning of the year. If he wanted to receive only the mainpublications, or was a member of our specialist book club or one of our other marketing programmes, that would be shown by a different set ofreference numbers. Also if he were behind with his subscriptionpayments.'

￼'And this information is shown on all the monitors throughout mebuilding?' 'Yes. It's not information we regard as particularly confidential.'

'And if you felt like bending the rules a little and wanted to make me asubscriber to your comprehensive literature service, could you do that,enter my details from this terminal?'

'Without making the proper payments through the accounts department,you mean? Why... yes.'

Spence was beginning to follow her line of enquiry.

'You think that Charles Collingridge's details were falsely entered from aterminal within this building, Miss Storin? Yes, it could be done. Look.' Within a few seconds the screen was showing a comprehensiveliterature subscription in the name of 'M Mouse Esq, 99 DisneylandMiami.'

'But you couldn't get away with backdating it to the beginning of the yearbecause... What a stupid fool I am!

Of course!' he exploded, and startedthrashing away at the keyboard. If you really know what you're doing,which very few people in this building do, you can tap into the mainframe subdirectory...'

His words were almost drowned in the clattering of the keys.

That gives access to the more restricted financial data.

So I can check the exact date when the account was paid, whether itwas paid by cheque or credit card, when the subscription was firststarted...'

The monitor screen started glowing.

'And those financial details can only be entered or altered by accountsdepartment staff with their security passwords’

He sat back to consider the details on the screen. He tapped a fewmore characters into the computer, and then turned to Mattie.

'Miss Storin. According to this, Mr Collingridge has never paid for theliterature service, this month or any month. His details only appear on thedistribution file, not the payment file.'

'Can you tell me when his name first appeared on the distribution file?'

A few more keystrokes.

'Jesus. Exactly two weeks ago today.'

'So someone in this building, not the accounts staff or anyone whounderstood computers very well, two weeks ago altered the file toinclude Charles Collingridge's name for the first time.'

This is terrible, Miss Storin...' Spence's face had gone white.

'Kevin, can you by any chance tell me who might have altered the file, orfrom which terminal it was altered?'

'Sadly, no. It could have been done from any terminal in this building. Thecomputer programme trusts us ...' He shook his head as if he had totally failed the most crucial test of his life.

‘Don't worry, Kevin. We're on the trail. But I must ask you not to utter aword of this to anyone. I want to catch whoever did this, and if he knows we're looking he will cover his trail. Will you help me once more, andkeep quiet until I have something more to go on?'

'Who on earth would believe me, anyway?' he murmured.

￼SUNDAY 7th NOVEMBER

The newspapers that weekend were irritable. In the convention of leadership elections, candidates were discouraged from outright electioneering or making personal attacks on their rivals; the right leader was supposed somehow still to 'emerge' without any apparent effort on his part from a process of consensus rather than combat. So all the press had been left with for ten days was a series of coded messages which failed to inspire the public or ignite the hoped-for forest of press headlines. The campaign had not so much run out of steam; it had simply never generated any effective heat

So the press took it out on the candidates - they had no alternative. 'A disappointing and uninspiring campaign so far, still waiting for one of the candidates to breathe life back into the Party and Government', pronounced the Observer. Irrelevant and irritating', complained the Sunday Minor. Not to be outdone, the Sun in characteristic style described it all as 'flatulent, a passing breeze in the night'.

Far from allowing a thorough airing of the issues, as Urquhart had predicted to the Prime Minister, the lengthy campaign was suffering from a severe dose of boredom, as all along he had secretly hoped.

This came as little comfort to Mattie, who was finding her growing conviction that skulduggery was afoot matched only by her inability to find the opportunity to proceed with her investigations. Journalists have to work much harder when there is no news to report, and the flaccid leadership campaign was causing more than a few nightmares amongst the political lobby in their collective efforts to find new angles with which to fill their column inches.

You have to face it, Mattie, you still don't have a case’ Johnnie told her. 'Fascinating circumstantial evidence about computers, perhaps, but what about the shares, what about the bank account, what about Paddington?'

She unwrapped herself from his arms where she had been dozing for most of Sunday afternoon. The weather was appalling, the scudding grey skies hurling angry bursts of rain against the windows. They hadn't needed much encouragement to decide to spend the whole afternoon in bed.

Those shares were bought by whoever had the bank account and arranged the false address in Paddington’ Mattie began, marshalling her arguments. 'That's the only conclusion you can reasonably reach. But the trail is very difficult to follow. Apart from telling us that the account was opened for less than a fortnight, the bank will tell us nothing, and have point-blank refused to let us see the signatures on the documents relating to the bank account. And the Paddington tobacconist's is even less helpful. I think all the attention and notoriety has put paid to some of the more profitable sidelines which he seems to have run out of his back room.'

Johnnie was not finished. 'But what is it you are trying to prove? The documentation is scarcely going to tell you any more than you know already. What you need to establish is not so much whether it was Charles Collingridge, but whether it could have been anyone other than him. If it could, along with your computer tampering you might have the beginnings of a circumstantial story.'

She rolled out of his arms to look him directly in the face. 'You still don't believe it was a frame-up, do you?'

'You haven't even yet proved that a crime was committed, let alone having any idea as to who might have done it’ he argued, but his voice softened as he recognised the growing impatience in her eyes. You have to be realistic, Mattie. If you are going to launch yourself publicly into this great conspiracy theory, you will have a very sceptical audience who will want more than a few 'maybes'. If you turn out to be wrong, you will do yourself and your career a lot of harm. And should you turn out to be right, you're going to have some very powerful enemies out there, who could do you

even more harm. If they can nobble the Prime Minister, what could they do to you?’I He stroked her hair tenderly.

It's not a matter of whether I believe your theory, Mattie. It's a matter of caring about you, of not wanting you to get caught in something which could be bigger than both of us and could cause you a great deal of pain. Frankly I'm scared you might be taking this one a bit too far. Is it really worth it?'

Instantly he knew he had said something wrong. He didn't know why, but he sensed her body go rigid, unresponsive, enveloped by a cold shell that had suddenly divided the bed in two.

Hell, Johnnie, I would be even more scared if it turned out to be true and nobody did anything about it,' she snapped. 'And damn it, it was you who encouraged me to go after the story.'

'But that was before... well, before you got into my bed and into my life. This isn't just another story for me, Mattie, this is personal. I really care about you.'

'So that's it. Drop the bloody story and concentrate on getting laid. Thanks, but no thanks! I asked you to go to bed with me, Johnnie, not own me.'

She rolled away from him so that he could no longer see her face. She could sense his bewilderment and pain, but how could she tell him. The feeling of panic which had come over her as he confronted her with a choice between her career and his caring. God, it was' going to happen all over again.

'Look, Johnnie ...' She was having tremendous difficulty finding the right words. ‘I am fond of you - very fond, you know that. But my career is most important to me. This story is most important to me. I can't let anything else get in its way’ She paused for a painful moment. 'Perhaps we made a mistake.'

￼'What are you saying? Goodbye? Just like that? You drag me into bed as if I'm the last caveman left on earth for a couple of hot nights and then -

￼bugger off ? What is it? Just adding to your collection of notches on the bedpost?'

The sarcasm bit deep and rattled her. ‘I needed you, Johnnie. I needed a man, not a lifelong commitment, I needed to feel like a woman again, it had been so long...'

'Great. A million pricks out there and you had to pick this one. I didn't realise it was just that, Mattie. I really wish you hadn't bothered,' he said with evident bitterness and anger.

'Johnnie, stop! This isn't right. Don't make me say something I don't mean. I like you, very much. That's the problem.'

'That's a problem? Well, I'm glad you have managed to put it behind you.' He gave a dry, humourless laugh and stared straight at the ceiling.

Mattie buried her head in the pillow. She hadn't intended to hurt him, but how could she make him understand. She hadn't told anyone in London before, but maybe now was the time.

There was someone else,' she began, her voice faltering. In Yorkshire. Someone I was very close to. We had known each other since we were children and everyone assumed that our relationship was... sort of permanent. That was the trouble. No one asked me, they just assumed. But I wanted something more, and when he forced me to choose between him and my career, I chose my career. It was the

only way for me to live with myself, Johnnie!' she exclaimed, as if fearing that he would neither understand nor accept. His cold expression told her she was right.

'But... he went to pieces. There were begging letters, midnight telephone calls. I would see Him just standing at the end of my street, waiting for hours, sometimes all through the night.'

She drew a deep breath as if the memory were exhausting her. Then, there was a car crash. A long, straight piece of road with no other traffic, and his car hit a tree. They had to cut him out. When I heard, it was as if it were all my fault, as if I had been the one who had crashed the car. I felt so guilty, do you see, yet I felt so angry with myself for feeling that way. I hadn't done anything wrong!'
